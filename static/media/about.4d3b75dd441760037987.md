## 👩‍💻 From Networking Curiosity to Cybersecurity Engineer

My journey into cybersecurity began during my undergraduate studies at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. A core networking class introduced me to the basics of network protocols and infrastructure, but what truly captured my interest was a short module on network security. That segment sparked a curiosity that quickly turned into a passion.

I began diving deeper into security concepts on my own and eventually started assisting professors with related research. This led to multiple research publications by the time I graduated in 2022. Encouraged by this momentum and my growing interest in safeguarding digital infrastructure, I decided to pursue a Master's degree focused entirely on cybersecurity.

## 🎓 Graduate Studies & Advanced Training

In 2022, right after my undergrad, I enrolled in Rutgers University, New Jersey, to pursue a Master of Business & Science in Cybersecurity. My academic journey here was transformative—I gained hands-on experience in threat modeling, risk assessment, IAM (Identity and Access Management), and security automation. My coursework and capstone projects laid the foundation for mastering industry tools like Microsoft Sentinel, AWS GuardDuty, Terraform, and various IAM technologies.

## 🔐 Building a Cybersecurity Career

Since completing my graduate degree, I've worked with organizations such as Baanyan Software Services Inc. and NJCCIC, where I've built and automated IAM solutions across Azure and AWS using Terraform and Python. I've also designed risk mitigation strategies aligned with TSA and NIST frameworks, contributed to threat detection using Chronicle SIEM and Security Command Center in GCP, and enforced Zero Trust principles through SSO, MFA, Conditional Access, and PIM integrations.

# 🧰 What I’ve Worked With

- 📌 At **Baanyan Software Services Inc.**, automated least-privilege IAM across Azure and AWS using Terraform and PIM, reducing standing admin access by 100% across hybrid cloud estates.
- 📌 At **Collaborative Solutions LLC**, performed TSA and NIST-based risk assessments on rail infrastructure, reducing vulnerability exposure by 35% through remediation plans.
- 📌 At **NJCCIC**, containerized a SpiderFoot-based attack surface platform on AWS, cutting external asset exposure windows by 35%.
- 📌 At **National Technical & R D Committee**, built a Python-based ARP spoofing detector that reduced incident response time by 40% through real-time network alerts.

## 🛠️ Skills Snapshot

- Cloud Security (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- IAM (Microsoft Entra ID, AWS IAM, SailPoint)
- Policy-as-Code (OPA, Terraform Sentinel)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, GitHub Actions)
- Digital Forensics & Threat Detection (Autopsy, Sentinel, GuardDuty)
- Governance, Risk & Compliance (NIST, ISO 27001, SOX)

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I’m passionate about building secure, scalable, and automated cloud infrastructures that not only detect and prevent threats but also enhance compliance and operational resilience. Whether it's IAM hardening, forensic analysis, or policy automation, I strive to bring innovation and precision to every solution I deliver.
